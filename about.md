title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Nicholas Miklaucic. I’m a high school student at Phillips Academy Andover. In my
spare time, I love to code—from machine learning projects, to data visualization, to
mathematically-inspired programs, to random projects that pique my interest. This blog will serve as
the repository of the most interesting and valuable of these side projects. All of the code that I
use here on this blog will be available on [Github](http://github.com/nicholas-miklaucic/), and I
encourage anyone who enjoys these projects to contribute to them with anything that feels like a
good addition.


Mostly, I will be using Python for these projects, along with the Python data stack (`numpy`,
`pandas`, Jupyter, etc.) and Keras for machine learning. I code using Emacs: I may also post about
the work I’ve done to make my editing experience as flawless as can be.

If you have any comments, questions, criticisms, or anything you think I should know, don’t hesitate
to contact me at [nicholas.miklaucic@gmail.com](mailto:nicholas.miklaucic@gmail.com). My Github
username is [nicholas-miklaucic](http://github.com/nicholas-miklaucic/).
